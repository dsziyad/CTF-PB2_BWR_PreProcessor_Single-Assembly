# CTF-PB2_BWR_PreProcessor_Single-Assembly

The preprocessor can create all 6 assembly types of PB2 Benchmark, with and without modelling bypass regions.

It can also create random channel matrix such as 2x2, 3x3, 4x4 etc, with rod centered geometry. For this random assemblies, the geometry
specifications are same as Assembly type 1.

Open the PB2BWRPreprocessor matlab file and read the header for more information. For Assembly specifications details, the Benchmark by
Solis et. al. is provided in the pdf file.
